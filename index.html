  <h3>Programming languages I like to use</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Python - Pretty much my go-to language. Especially when starting a personal project, my question to myself
often is, "Is there any reason why I wouldn't want to use Python for this?". I like its simplicity and how it's written
in a way where the syntax just makes a lot of sense. There's a lot that can be done with a few lines of code, so when
coding I try to maintain a nice balance of readability instead of doing something really efficiently that may work but look
like a mess.</li>
		<br/>
      <li>Perl - I kind of think of Perl like "Bash++". Really good for interfacing with the system and for more complex
system programming scripts. Used a lot at one of my previous jobs, but haven't really been motivated to do much with it
since. Python kind of replaces any more complex tooling or web design I would do with this. Regardless, I still have an
affinity towards Perl and think it can be useful in the right situations. When coding in Perl, I try to make things as
readable and understandable to an external user as possible.</li>
		<br/>
      <li>C/C++ - I learned in C++ and taught myself C through the book <a href="http://knking.com/books/c/">C Programming: 
A Modern Approach</a> by <a href="http://knking.com/index.html">K.N. King</a>. I don't have much of a need to use these 
languages frequently, but I like to play around with them from time to time. I like to have them in my back pocket as 
lower-ish level languages I'm familiar with. I think writing in them gives me a better
understanding of how more complex algorithms and data structures are designed.</li>
		<br/>
      <li>Bash - Its syntax is ugly, but I'm comfortable enough with it to write some decent utilities and system scripts.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Programming languages I'm learning how to use better</h3>
    <ul>
		<li>C++ - I know this one decently well, but re-learning it has helped me learn more about programming in general.
There's not really an end in sight for how comfortable you can get with a language like this, so it's something I'm
pushing myself to learn better and I think it makes me a better programmer in any language.</li>
		<br/>
      <li>Rust - I honestly don't know much about Rust, but it has a cool name, and sounds like it has the potential to
be a more modern replacement for C/C++</li>
    </ul>
