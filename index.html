  <h1>Andy Gnias</h1>
  <h2>Python Developer, DevSecOps Engineer, Data Science Enthusiast</h2>
  <p>My name is Andy Gnias and I like to code. I graduated from Drexel in 2016
 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, and I currently work as a Software Engineer. I'm
 really interested in writing tools to automate tasks, and I've done a lot of interesting
 DevSecOps work over the past couple of years. I'm also learning more about data science
 and machine learning. 
<br/><br/>
In addition to softwawre, I like to play piano, play soccer, read, and pet my dog.</p>

  <h3>Programming languages I like to use</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Python - My go-to language. I like its simplicity in its syntax, and how easy it is to do complex tasks in a
 few lines of code. The more I've used Python, the greater appreciation I have for how
powerful its built-in functions can be and how efficiently they allow you to write code.</li>
		<br/>
      <li>Perl - Good for interfacing with the system and for more complex system programming scripts. Used a lot at one
 of my previous jobs, but haven't really been motivated to do much with it recently. Python would be my first choice for
 any tooling or web design projects, but I still have an affinity towards Perl and think it can be useful in the right
 situations. When coding in Perl, I try to make things as readable and understandable to an external user as possible.</li>
		<br/>
      <li>C/C++ - I learned in C++ and taught myself C through the book <a href="http://knking.com/books/c/"
target="_blank">C Programming:
 A Modern Approach</a> by <a href="http://knking.com/index.html" target="_blank">K.N. King</a>. I don't have a need to use these 
 languages frequently, but I like to have them as lower-ish level languages I'm familiar with. Using them gives me a better
 understanding of how more complex algorithms and data structures are designed.</li>
		<br/>
      <li>Bash - Not ideal for larger projects, but I'm good enough at scripting with it to write some decent utilities and system scripts.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Programming languages I'm learning how to use better</h3>
    <ul>
		<li>C++ - I know this one decently well, but re-learning it has helped me learn more about programming in general.
 I'm pushing myself to learn more as I think it makes me a better coder in any language.</li>
		<br/>
      <li>Rust - I'm just starting out with Rust, and I don't know much about it, but it has a cool name, and sounds like
 it has the potential to be a more modern replacement for C/C++. So far, have worked through some
 <a href="https://projecteuler.net/profile/AGnias47.png" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> problems with it.</li>
    </ul>
