        <h1>Andy Gnias</h1>
        <h2>Fellow Human and Software Engineer</h2>
        <p>My name is Andy Gnias and I like to code. I graduated from Drexel in 2016 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. Immediately thereafter, I took a job in software, and after 6 years in the industry I've almost fully quelled my impostor syndrome.</p>
        <p>
            I have pretty extensive experience in all things development, have worked a good bit with DevSecOps and cloud based-tooling, and have occasionally done my best impression of a machine learning engineer. When coding, I take as much pride in a well written
            docstring as a well written algorithm.</p>
        <p>I currently work as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.arcadia.com/" target="_blank">Arcadia</a>, where I work on data scraping projects and get to fulfill my dream of fighting the climate crisis with code. I'm also taking graduate courses
            in Computer Science at Temple University.
            <br /><br /> In my free time, I like to read, play piano, do CrossFit, and pet my dog.
        </p>

        <h3>Here's some of my projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.andygnias.com/secret-santa/" target="_blank">Secret Santa Selections Manager</a> - I've used this to manage the Secret Santa I do with my friend group for the past 5 years and it hasn't failed me yet. One of the first
                times I got an idea and realized I could solve it with software.</li>
            <br />
            <li><a href="https://www.andygnias.com/spotify-playlist-generator/" target="_blank">Spotify Playlist
                    Generator</a> - This takes a list of songs and puts it in a Spotify playlist. I got the idea when my mom gave me a word doc of songs for my sister's wedding shower and asked me to make a playlist out of it. I didn't finish it in time
                for the shower, but it's been a fun Python project that I've personally used a few times since.</li>
            <br />
            <li><a href="https://www.andygnias.com/grocery-list/" target="_blank">Grocery List Creator</a> - Takes a list of recipes and generates a list of ingredients for grocery shopping. Uses a very limited open source API, and definitely needs some improvements
                to be useful, but it's a fun concept that I'd love to expand on some more.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>These are the programming languages I like to use</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Python - My go-to</li>
            <br />
            <li>C/C++ - I used pointers before they were smart</li>
            <br />
            <li>Java - Because static typing is cool sometimes</li>
            <br />
            <li>JavaScript - Really I mean Node.js</li>
            <br />
            <li>Rust - Seems like an improved C++, but need to force myself to choose using it over Python. Have done some
                <a href="https://projecteuler.net/profile/AGnias47.png" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> problems with it and am working on a
                <a href="https://github.com/AGnias47/ticket-to-ride-graph-analysis" target="_blank">graph analysis</a> project with it.
