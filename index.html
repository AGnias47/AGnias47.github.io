        <h1>Andy Gnias</h1>
        <h2>Fellow Human and Software Engineer</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Andy Gnias and I like to code. I graduated from Drexel in 2016 with a B.S. in Mechanical
            Engineering.
            Immediately thereafter, I took a job in software, and after 8 years in the industry, I've almost fully
            quelled my impostor syndrome.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have extensive experience in backend development, have worked a good bit with DevSecOps and cloud-based
            tooling, and have done some work in machine learning through my graduate program.
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently work as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.arcadia.com/" target="_blank">Arcadia</a>,
            where I write Python modules to automate the collection and processing of utility data. I'm also pursuing a
            Master's degree in Computer Science at Temple University.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I like to read, play soccer, do CrossFit, and ski.
        </p>

        <h3>Here are some of my projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.andygnias.com/secret-santa/" target="_blank">Secret Santa Selections Manager</a> -
                Manages Secret Santa selections. Makes selections considering exceptions, and then alerts participants
                of who they are assigned to give a gift to via email.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.andygnias.com/spotify-playlist-generator/" target="_blank">Spotify Playlist
                    Generator</a> -
                Takes a text-based list of songs and puts it in a Spotify playlist.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.andygnias.com/march-madness/" target="_blank">March Madness Predictor</a> - Used
                for creating a bracket for the Men's NCAA Division 1 Basketball Tournament. Offers an evaluation and
                prediction mode. Evaluation mode is a manual bracket selection process that provides relevant
                information to a user when making selections, such as rankings, recent game results, etc. Prediction
                mode makes automated selections using various prediction methods.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.andygnias.com/ticket-to-ride-graph-analysis/" target="_blank">Ticket to Ride Graph
                    Analysis</a> -
                Basic analysis of the board game Ticket to Ride, modelling the board as an undirected graph in Rust.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.andygnias.com/grocery-list/" target="_blank">Grocery List Creator</a> - Takes a
                list of recipes and generates a list of ingredients for grocery shopping. Uses a very limited open
                source API, and definitely needs some improvements to be useful, but it's a fun concept that I'd love to
                expand on some more.
