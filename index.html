  <h1>Andy Gnias</h1>
  <h2>Fellow Human and Software Engineer</h2>
  <p>My name is Andy Gnias and I like to code. I graduated from Drexel in 2016
 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. Immediately thereafter, I took a job in software, looked back 
a few times, decided to keep going and am pretty happy with the results thus far.
<br/><br/>
Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.arcadia.com/" target="_blank">Arcadia</a> working on renewable energy
utility management. 
I'm also pursuing a Graduate Certificate (12 grad credits) in Computer Science at Temple University. I have
pretty extensive experience in all things development as well as DevSecOps, and have dabbled in just about everything except frontend. 
I take as much pride in a well written docstring as I do a well written algorithm.
<br/><br/>
In my free time, I like to read, play piano, do CrossFit, and pet my dog.</p>

  <h3>Here's some of my projects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.andygnias.com/Secret_Santa/" target="_blank">Secret Santa Selections Manager</a> - I've
used this to manage the Secret Santa I do with my friend group for the past 5 years and it hasn't failed me yet.
One of the first times I got an idea and realized I could solve it with software.</li>
      <br/>
      <li><a href="https://www.andygnias.com/spotify-playlist-generator/" target="_blank">Spotify Playlist Generator</a>
- This takes a list of songs and puts it in a Spotify playlist. I got the idea when my mom gave me a word doc of
  songs for my sister's wedding shower and asked me to make a playlist out of it. I didn't finish it in time for the
shower, but it's been a fun Python project that I've personally used a few times since.</li>
      <br/>
      <li><a href="https://www.andygnias.com/grocery-list/" target="_blank">Grocery List Creator</a> - Takes a list of
recipes and generates a list of ingredients for grocery shopping. Uses a very limited open source API, and definitely
needs some improvements to be useful, but it's a fun concept that I'd love to expand on some more.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="content">
  <h3>These are the programming languages I like to use</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Python - My go-to</li>
        <br/>
      <li>C/C++ - I used pointers before they were smart</li>
        <br/>
      <li>Java - Because static typing is cool sometimes</li>
        <br/>
      <li>JavaScript - Really I mean Node.js</li>
        <br/>
      <li>Rust - I'm just starting out with Rust, but I like its ownership model, and it sounds like it has the 
potential to be a more modern replacement for C/C++. So far, I've worked through some
 <a href="https://projecteuler.net/profile/AGnias47.png" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> problems with it.</li>
    </ul>
