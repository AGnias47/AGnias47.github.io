        <p>
            My name is Andy Gnias and I like to code. I graduated from Drexel in 2016 with a degree in Mechanical
            Engineering.
            Immediately thereafter, I took a job in software. After several more software jobs and a Master's degree in Computer Science, I've almost fully
            quelled my impostor syndrome.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have extensive experience in backend development, have worked a good bit with DevSecOps and cloud-based
            tooling, and have done some work in machine learning through my graduate program at Temple.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I like to read, play soccer, and ski.
