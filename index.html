        <h1>Andy Gnias</h1>
        <h2>Fellow Human and Software Engineer</h2>
        <p>My name is Andy Gnias and I like to code. I graduated from Drexel in 2016 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. Immediately thereafter, I took a job in software, and after 6 years in the industry I've almost fully quelled my impostor syndrome.</p>
        <p>
            I have extensive experience in backend development, have worked a good bit with DevSecOps and cloud based-tooling, and have done some work in machine learning through my graduate program.</p>
        <p>I currently work as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.arcadia.com/" target="_blank">Arcadia</a>, where I write Python modules to automate the collection and processing of utility data. I'm also pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Temple University.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to read, play soccer, do CrossFit, and pet my dog.</p>

        <h3>Here are some of my projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.andygnias.com/secret-santa/" target="_blank">Secret Santa Selections Manager</a> - I've used this to manage the Secret Santa I do with my friend group for the past 6 years. One of the first times I got an idea and realized I could solve it with software.</li>
            <br />
            <li><a href="https://www.andygnias.com/spotify-playlist-generator/" target="_blank">Spotify Playlist
                    Generator</a> - Takes a list of songs and puts it in a Spotify playlist. I got the idea when my mom gave me a word doc of songs for my sister's wedding shower and asked me to make a playlist out of it. I didn't finish it in time
                for the shower, but it's been a fun Python project that I've personally used a few times since.</li>
                <br />
            <li><a href="https://www.andygnias.com/ticket-to-ride-graph-analysis/" target="_blank">Ticket to Ride Graph Analysis</a> - Does a basic analysis on the board game Ticket to Ride, modelling the board as an undirected graph in Rust.</li><br />
            <li><a href="https://www.andygnias.com/grocery-list/" target="_blank">Grocery List Creator</a> - Takes a list of recipes and generates a list of ingredients for grocery shopping. Uses a very limited open source API, and definitely needs some improvements
                to be useful, but it's a fun concept that I'd love to expand on some more.</li>

        <h3>These are the programming languages I like to use</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Python - My go-to</li>
            <br />
            <li>C++ - I used pointers before they were smart</li>
            <br />
            <li>Java - Because static typing is cool sometimes</li>
            <br />
            <li>JavaScript - Really I mean Node.js</li>
            <br />
            <li>Rust - Still overusing .clone() but enjoying it as an improved C++</li>
            <br />
            <li>C - Don't use it a ton, but its given me a good understanding of how higher level languages and operating systems actually work</li>
